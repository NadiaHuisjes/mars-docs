<p>This tutorial focuses on the calculation of the variance (var) in the traces obtained after running the “Peak Tracker” tool. To do so, a Molecule Archive .yama file with the data of the traces of interest is needed. To create such an archive, look at the tutorial <a href="https://duderstadt-lab.github.io/mars-docs/tutorials/workingwithmars/create-a-Molecule-Archive/">Let’s Make a Molecule Archive</a>. Alternatively, one can also use the tutorial file from the repository <a href="[git tutorials repository](https://github.com/duderstadt-lab/mars-tutorials).">Testvideoarchive.yama</a></p>

<h3 id="1-open-the-molecule-archive-yama">1. Open the Molecule Archive (.yama)</h3>
<p>First, open the archive using the “Molecule” tool. The <strong>Mars Rover</strong> GUI should show up.</p>

<h3 id="2-run-the-variance-calculator">2. Run the Variance Calculator</h3>
<p>Now go back to the main Fiji environment and select the “Variance Calculator” from the <strong>Mars</strong> plugins.</p>

<p><img align="center" src="/tutorials/img/Tvar/img2.png" width="450" /></p>

<p>The following window will show up. Provide the settings as shown.</p>

<p><img align="center" src="/tutorials/img/Tvar/img3.png" width="450" /></p>

<p>In the case of this example data set, the variance is calculated for the movement in the direction of the y-axis. Provide a parameter name and press OK.
For more information about the experimental background of this example dataset go to the <a href="https://duderstadt-lab.github.io/mars-docs/tutorials/workingwithmars/create-a-Molecule-Archive/">Let’s Make a Molecule Archive Tutorial</a>.</p>

<h3 id="3-show-the-results-in-mars-rover">3. Show the Results in Mars Rover</h3>
<p>After the calculator has run go back to <strong>Rover</strong> and open any of the molecule UUIDs to show the plot. Next to the plot window a window with more options is found (f.e. for molecule tagging). Click on the parameters tab (next to the information icon on the top). This should show a list of obtained parameters - at this moment only showing the var parameter just calculated. Since the variance is a property of a trace one value is calculated per molecule (UUID).</p>

<p>When exploring the molecules two different populations are found: the population tagged “Active” with a high variance &amp; the untagged population with a low variance. This is to be expected since active polymerase molecules are expected to travel a longer distance on the DNA than the molecules that are not active. In section 4 it is discussed how these two populations can be visualised in a histogram on the <strong>Rover</strong> dashboard.</p>

<p>Now save the archive again to retain the calculated values.</p>

<p>To further analyse the variance values f.e. by means of plotting, have a look at the <a href="https://duderstadt-lab.github.io/mars-docs/tutorials/marsto/open-a-Molecule-Archive-in-Python/">How to open a Molecule Archive in python</a> tutorial. Also have a look at the <a href="https://duderstadt-lab.github.io/mars-docs/tutorials/workingwithmars/scriptable-widgets/">How to use Scriptable Widgets</a> tutorial to see how the variance parameter can be used to understand the data in more depth using the scriptable widgets on <strong>Rover</strong> dashboard.</p>
