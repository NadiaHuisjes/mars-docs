#### File

| :------------- | :------------- |
| Save       | Save the created Molecule Archive in the format used currently (.yama for normally stored records, .sml for virtually stored records).      |
| Save a Copy       | Save a copy of the current Molecule Archive.       |
| Save a Json Copy | Save a copy of the current Molecule Archive in .yama.json format. |
| Save a Virtual Store Copy       | Save the current Molecule Archive as virtually stored archive with .sml format (smile encoded).       |
| Save a Json Virtual Store Copy | Save a copy of the current Molecule Archive in virtual storage using .json files |
| Close      | Close **Mars Rover**.|


A Molecule Archive can be saved in two ways:
1. Normal storage: saved in the .yama file format. Additionally a .yama.cfg file is saved containing information like settings and selections. A .cfg file can be renamed and reused for another archive to apply the settings defined for another Archive. By default files are stored using Smile encoding.
2. Virtual storage: saves a .yama.sml folder containing .sml files for the indexes, properties, all molecule UIDs and experiment IDs separately. Choose this saving mode when dealing with large data sets.


#### Tools

| :------------- | :------------- |
| Delete Molecules      | Delete molecules with a specific tag or all molecules without tag.     |
| Delete Molecule Tag       | Delete a specified or all tag(s).       |
| Delete Molecule Parameters       |  Delete a specified or all calculated parameter(s).      |
| Delete Molecule Regions | Delete a specified or all regions specified in the molecules tab.|
| Delete Molecule Positions | Delete a specified or all positions in the molecule tab.|
| Delete Segment Tables       | Deletes segment tables generated by the kinetic change point analysis.       |
| Merge Molecules       | Merges the data tables of multiple molecules. Use f.e. if a tracking result appears to be split into multiple smaller tracked segments.       |
| Show Video      | Shows the video at a specific position corresponding to a tracked molecule. See also the [tutorial](https://duderstadt-lab.github.io/mars-docs/tutorials/workingwithmars/bdv/) on finding tracked molecules in the video.      |
| Export Video      | Exports the video at a specific position corresponding to a tracked molecule. See also the [tutorial](https://duderstadt-lab.github.io/mars-docs/tutorials/workingwithmars/bdv/) on finding tracked molecules in the video, step 5.        |
| Rebuild indexes      | Rebuild the index.json file when operating in virtual storage.        |
