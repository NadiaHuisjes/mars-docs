This tutorial explores the **Rover** option to show a tracked molecule in the original video. This eminently useful function can be used for visual examination of the molecule after analysis for validation of the observed behavior. This would rule out flaws in tracking having a major impact on the drawn conclusion from the data.

The video viewer is based on [BigDataViewer](https://imagej.net/BigDataViewer#Description)<sup>1</sup> and as such requires converting the video of interest to the BigDataViewer file format XML/HDF5 or in the [XML/N5](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5) format.
