The Rover Desktop gives an overview of the data collected in the Molecule Archive.
Widgets can be selected from the toolbar with a click. The scripting language can be switched between Groovy or Python in the drop down menu and all widgets can either be cleared from the desktop (bomb icon), stopped loading (square) or refreshed (refresh button) simultaneously.

#### Predefined widgets

The predefined widgets give a first glance at the data. As shown in the example, the
information widget shows the name of the archive, the archive type, the amount of molecules in the archive, the amount of metadata files and which type of memory is used for storage ('Normal' or 'Virtual Mode'). The tag widget shows a bar plot of the amount of molecules that are categorised by a certain tag.
Update the widgets after a change in the archive by pressing the refresh button.

Scriptable widgets can be customised fully to show parameters of interest.

There are four predefined scriptable widgets: a Category Chart, Histogram,
XY chart, and Bubble chart. Click on the <> tab to change the script, click on the book icon to show the script log. To show examples of these plot types load the widgets and press the refresh button.
